# Majora

## What is Majora?
Majora is an audio player project. There's a terminal version I made for testing and a desktop GUI version using [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia), a cross-platform UI framework for .NET.

## How do I run it?
You can get the latest binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Bheithir/releases). **There are 64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux builds available for the terminal and desktop GUI program.**

## What file types are supported right now?
### GUI Desktop Application
The GUI desktop application uses [LibVLC](https://wiki.videolan.org/LibVLC/) so it should support all audio formats supports VLC supports including:
- [Waveform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV)
    - Standard (`*.wav`, `*.wave`) and 64-bit (`*.w64`)
- [Free Lossless Audio Codec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC)
    - `*.flac`

    - Includes MPEG-4 and Apple containers

### Terminal Program
The terminal program still uses different libraries and I don't end to change it. It supports these formats:
- [Waveform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV)
    - Standard (`*.wav`, `*.wave`) and 64-bit (`*.w64`)
- [Free Lossless Audio Codec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC)
    - `*.flac`
- [Ogg Vorbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis)
    - `*.ogg`

    - Usually encoded with the [μ-law algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-law_algorithm)

## Is it functional?
Both the the terminal and desltop program and are completely functional. At the moment, no further development will done. Please see the [releases page](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Majora/releases) for further details on completed features and how to use the programs. Check the [issues](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Bheithir/issues) tab for any issues.

## What the hell is this name?
The name is a reference to the video game, [*The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask). In the game, you help various people in the main quests, each time getting a special song or instrument associated with that race (Goron, Zora, etc.). As such, the progression is tied to the music. The meaning and impact of the game is tied to this musical progression. There's no special association with this progression however. I just like the name and the reference.
