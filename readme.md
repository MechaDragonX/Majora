# Majora

## What is Majora?
Majora is an audio player project. Right now all that's available is a terminal version, but I hope to have GUI versions avialable ***soonâ„¢***.

## What file types are supported right now?
- [Waveform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV)
    - Standard (`*.wav`, `*.wave`) and 64-bit (`*.w64`)
- [Free Lossless Audio Codec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC)
    - `*.flac`
- [Ogg Vorbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis)
    - `*.ogg`
- [MPEG-1/MPEG-2 Audio Layer III ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3)
    - MP3
    - `*.mp3`
- [Advanced Audio Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding)
    - Includes MPEG-4 and Apple containers
    - `*.aac` and `*.m4a`
- [Audio Interchange File Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Interchange_File_Format)
    - `*.aiff`

## How do I run it?
You can get the latest binaries from the [releases tab](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Bheithir/releases). **There are 64-bit Windows, macOS, and Linux builds available.**

## Is it functional?
At the moment it should be... Check the [issues](https://github.com/MechaDragonX/Bheithir/issues) tab for any issues.

## What the hell is this name?
The name is a reference to the video game, [*The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask). In the game, you help various people in the main quests, each time getting a special song or instrument associated with that race (Goron, Zora, etc.). As such, the progression is tied to the music. The meaning and impact of the game is tied to this musical progression. There's no special association with this progression however. I just like the name and the reference.

## When will this be done?
Well...the terminal version is functional, but I wanna make a GUI version...so let's say it's *in progress*.
